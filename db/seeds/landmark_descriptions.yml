    Recreational fishing, also called sport fishing,
    is fishing for pleasure or competition. It can be contrasted
    with commercial fishing, which is fishing for profit,
    or subsistence fishing, which is fishing for survival.

    a Macedonian way of catching fish... They fasten red (crimson red)
    wool round a hook, and fix on to the wool two feathers which grow
    under a cock's wattles, and which in colour are like wax. Their rod
    is six feet long, and their line is the same length. Then they
    throw their snare, and the fish, attracted and maddened
    by the colour, comes straight at it...

    Sport fishing methods vary according to the area fished,
    the species targeted, the personal strategies of the angler,
    and the resources available. It ranges from the aristocratic art
    of fly fishing elaborated in Great Britain, to the high-tech
    methods used to chase marlin and tuna. Sport fishing is usually done
    with hook, line, rod and reel rather than with nets or other aids.

    Fishing tackle is a general term that refers to the equipment used
    by fishers. Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called

    reels, baits, lures, spears, nets, traps, waders and tackle boxes.

    In addition to capturing fish for food, recreational anglers might also
    keep a log of fish caught and submit trophy-sized fish to independent
    record keeping bodies. In the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Specimen Fish
    Committee verifies and publicizes the capture of trophy fish caught with
    rod and line by anglers in Ireland, both in freshwater and at sea.
